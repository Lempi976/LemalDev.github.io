        <p>I started with Html 3 months ago, because my dream was always to learn how to build a Website.</p>
        I learnt many things by myself, but I watched many tutorials to learn more. Than I started to use Css to make my Website nicer and more beautiful, learning Css wasn't really hard to understand for me.
        <p>Than 2 weeks after, I wanted to learn how to work with Javascript. I started to learn it, because you need it for making your own Website.</p>
        I coded with Javascript a Skate Trick Generator, which is linked in the navigator. I also coded a Login Form which is connected with a Gooogle Sheet to save the information.
